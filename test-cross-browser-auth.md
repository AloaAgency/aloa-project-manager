# Cross-Browser Authentication Fix

## Summary of Changes

The authentication issue where login works in Safari but fails in Chrome (and other browsers) has been fixed. The problem was related to PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) handling in the authentication callback.

## Root Cause

1. **PKCE Verification Issue**: Chrome and other browsers enforce stricter PKCE requirements than Safari
2. **Callback Handling**: The auth callback was trying to use `exchangeCodeForSession()` without proper PKCE verifier
3. **Cookie Configuration**: Cookie settings needed to be consistent across browsers

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Auth Callback (`/app/auth/callback/page.js`)
- Removed manual code exchange that was missing PKCE verifier
- Let Supabase client handle the callback automatically with proper PKCE flow
- Added proper error handling for auth failures
- Simplified the callback logic to rely on Supabase's built-in session management

### 2. Updated Supabase Browser Client (`/lib/supabase-browser.js`)
- Explicitly set `flowType: 'pkce'` in auth options
- Ensured consistent auth configuration across all browsers
- Maintained Safari private mode support with memory storage fallback

### 3. Updated Middleware (`/middleware.js`)
- Ensured consistent cookie settings across browsers
- Set `sameSite: 'lax'` for all auth cookies
- Removed domain setting to allow proper cookie handling

## Testing Instructions

1. **Clear all browser data** (cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage) for localhost:3001
2. **Test in Chrome:**
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3001
   - Login with your credentials
   - Verify that you stay logged in and reach the dashboard

3. **Test in Firefox:**
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3001
   - Login with your credentials
   - Verify that you stay logged in and reach the dashboard

4. **Test in Safari:**
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3001
   - Login with your credentials
   - Verify that login still works as before

5. **Test in Edge:**
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3001
   - Login with your credentials
   - Verify that you stay logged in and reach the dashboard

## Key Points

- The fix ensures PKCE flow is properly handled in all browsers
- Session management is now delegated to Supabase's built-in handlers
- Cookie configuration is consistent across all browsers
- The solution maintains backward compatibility with Safari

## If Issues Persist

If you still experience issues:

1. **Clear all browser data completely:**
   - Open Developer Tools > Application tab
   - Clear all cookies, localStorage, and sessionStorage for localhost

2. **Check the browser console for errors:**
   - Look for any PKCE-related errors
   - Check for cookie or CORS issues

3. **Restart the development server:**
   ```bash
   # Kill the current process
   # Then restart
   npm run dev -- --port 3001
   ```

4. **Verify environment variables:**
   - Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` are set correctly

The authentication should now work consistently across all modern browsers.
