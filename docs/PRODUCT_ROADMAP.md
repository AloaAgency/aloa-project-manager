## Implementation Philosophy

### Build vs. Buy
- **Build:** Core workflow, applets, project management (our differentiator)
- **Buy/Integrate:** Communication (Slack), Storage (S3), Email (Resend), Analytics (Mixpanel)

### Feature Prioritization Framework
1. **Must-Have:** Blocks core workflow or causes significant pain
2. **High-Value:** Used by >50% of users, saves >2 hours per project
3. **Nice-to-Have:** Improves experience but not critical
4. **Experimental:** Test with subset of users first

### Release Strategy
- **Weekly Patches:** Bug fixes, minor improvements
- **Monthly Features:** New applets, enhancements
- **Quarterly Milestones:** Major features (Phases 1-10)
- **Annual Themes:** Each year has focus area (2026 = Communication & Feedback)

---

## Investment Required

### Development Resources (per phase)
- **Phase 1-2:** 2 engineers, 4-6 weeks each
- **Phase 3-4:** 3 engineers, 6-8 weeks each
- **Phase 5-6:** 2 engineers + 1 designer, 6-8 weeks each
- **Phase 7:** 2 engineers + 1 data scientist, 8-10 weeks
- **Phase 8-9:** 3 engineers, 6-8 weeks each
- **Phase 10:** 4 engineers (2 iOS, 2 Android), 12-16 weeks

### Operational Costs
- **Infrastructure:** AWS/Supabase scaling ($500-2000/mo)
- **Third-Party APIs:** Anthropic, Resend, storage ($1000-5000/mo)
- **Support:** Customer success team (1 person per 50 active agencies)

---

## Competitive Moats

What makes this defensible:

1. **Network Effects** - More agencies = better benchmarks = more valuable insights
2. **Data Moat** - Project knowledge system learns and improves over time
3. **Workflow Lock-In** - Once agencies template their process, hard to switch
4. **Client Familiarity** - Clients trained on system, reduces agency switching costs
5. **Integration Depth** - Deep integrations with design/dev tools require significant effort to replicate
6. **Brand Trust** - Aloa brand + professional polish = perceived as enterprise-grade

---

## Why This Will Win

**The Problem We Solve:**
Agency-client projects are painful because:
1. Constant status check emails waste time
2. Collecting requirements is tedious and incomplete
3. Feedback loops take forever and lack clarity
4. Files are scattered across email, Slack, Drive, Dropbox
5. Clients feel confused and anxious about progress
6. Handoff is chaotic and incomplete

**Our Solution:**
A guided, gamified experience that:
1. Proactively communicates status without agency effort
2. Intelligently extracts and organizes requirements
3. Makes feedback fast, specific, and actionable
4. Centralizes all assets with version control
5. Shows clients exactly where they are and what's next
6. Automates handoff with documentation and training

**The Result:**
- **Agencies:** Save 20+ hours per project, run more projects simultaneously, increase margins
- **Clients:** Feel supported and informed, know exactly what to do, love the experience enough to refer others

**The Outcome:**
Aloa becomes the industry standard for agency-client collaboration. Every web design agency that wants to scale uses this platform. We capture 10-20% of the $40B+ web design services market.
